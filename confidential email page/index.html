      <h5>Dear Agent <span class="blurred">S'more,</span></h5>
      <p>We have an emergency. The secret formula for our <span class="blurred">Mega Marshmallow</span> has been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>
      <p>We suspect that <span class="blurred">Professor Puff</span> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.

</p>
      <p>Be sure to keep the <span class="blurred">lab's location</span> confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
